/**
 * @brief Thread Annotations
 *
 * The file contains annotations used for static thread safety analysis. They
 * allow developers to document the locking policies of multi-threaded code. The
 * annotations can also help program analysis tools to identify potential thread
 * safety issues.
 *
 * These annotations are implemented using compiler attributes. Using the macros
 * defined here instead of raw attributes allow for portability and future
 * compatibility.
 *
 * NOTE: The annotations currently only work for clang compiler. Since gcc does
 * not support static thread safety analysis, the annotations have no effect
 * when compiling with gcc.

 * Although this annotation (and PT_GUARDED_BY, below) cannot be applied to

 * have to annotate both locks with both ACQUIRED_AFTER and ACQUIRED_BEFORE.)

/**
 * @brief REQUIRES() / SHARED_LOCKS_REQUIRED()
 *
 * Documents a function that expects a mutex to be held prior to entry. The
 * mutex is expected to be held both on entry to, and exit from, the function.
 *
 * An exclusive lock allows read-write access to the guarded data member(s), and
 * only one thread can acquire a lock exclusively at any one time. A shared lock
 * allows read-only access, and any number of threads can acquire a shared lock
 * concurrently.
 *
 * Generally, non-const methods should be annotated with REQUIRES, while const
 * methods should be annotated with REQUIRES_SHARED.
 *
 * @example:
 *
 *  Mutex mu1, mu2;
 *  int a GUARDED_BY(mu1);
 *  int b GUARDED_BY(mu2);
 *
 *  void foo() REQUIRES(mu1, mu2) { ... }
